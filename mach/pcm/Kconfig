config MACH_PCM_SYS210
	bool
	prompt "v2.10"
	---help---
		System version 2.10

		This is the original variant and consist the parts:

		  ROM images:
		    - BIOS:  Basic I/O System
		    - SVDB:  System Visual Debugger
		    - VTAPE: Voice Tape Monitor

		Say yes here to generate the original RAM floppy system that
		was published in the German journal "Funkamateur" in 1988.

		This system version can only used together with the operating
		system CP/V (Control Program for V-Tape Microcomputers).

config MACH_PCM_SYS211
	bool
	prompt "v2.11"
	---help---
		System version 2.11

		This is the disassembled variant of 2.10 and consist the parts:

		  Assembler sources:
		    - BIOS:  Basic I/O System
		    - SVDB:  System Visual Debugger
		    - VTAPE: Voice Tape Monitor

		Say yes here to generate the disassembled RAM floppy system that
		was published in the German journal "Funkamateur" in 1988.

		This system version can only used together with the operating
		system CP/V (Control Program for V-Tape Microcomputers).

config MACH_PCM_SYS330
	bool
	prompt "v3.30"

		System version 3.30

		This is the original variant and consist the parts:

		  Assembler sources:
		    - BIOS:   Basic I/O System
		    - SVDB:   System Visual Debugger
		    - VTAPE:  Voice Tape Monitor
		    - DISKIO: Disk I/O Driver

		Say yes here to generate the original floppy disk system that
		was published in the German journal "Funkamateur" in 1990.

		This system version can only used together with the operating
		system CP/A (Control Program by AoS of GDR).

config MACH_PCM_SYS331
	bool
	prompt "v3.31"
	---help---
		System version 3.31

		This is the bug fixed version of 3.31 and consist the parts:

		  Assembler sources:
		    - BIOS:   Basic I/O System
		    - SVDB:   System Visual Debugger
		    - VTAPE:  Voice Tape Monitor
		    - DISKIO: Disk I/O Driver
